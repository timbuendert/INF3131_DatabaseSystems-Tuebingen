Exercise 1: Review Questions

Exercise 1.1
The five core operators of the relational algebra are projection (π), selection (σ), cartesian product (x), set union (∪) and set difference (\).
All query languages which are as expressive (can implement the same functionalities) as the relational algebra are considered relationally complete.

Exercise 1.2
Monotonic operators: as the input relation grows (more tuples), the new result of the operator will contain the old result (i.e., the old result is a subset of the new result).
Non-Monotonic operators: as the input relation grows (more tuples), the new result of the operator will not necessarily contain the old result, but may invalidate some of the old results.

Exercise 1.3
(a) With sch(R) ∩ sch(S) = {B}: 
R ⋈ S = π[A, B, C, D](σ[B = B1](R x π[B1←B, D](S)))

(b)
π[B](S) ∩ π[B](R) = π[B](R) \ (π[B](R) \ π[B](S))
