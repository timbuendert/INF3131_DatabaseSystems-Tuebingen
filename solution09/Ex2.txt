Exercise 2: Functional Dependencies

Exercise 2.1
a)
X <- {}
X <- {C, E}

1. Iteration
FD E -> D and E ELEMENT OF X:
X = {C, D, E}

2. Iteration
FD D -> A and D ELEMENT OF X and
FD D -> B and D ELEMENT OF X:
X = {A, B, C, D, E} = schema(R)

3. Iteration
X = {A, B, C, D, E} = schema(R), unchanged because all attributes are already included in the cover (but ABC would now be element of X)

{C,E}+ = {A, B, C, D, E}


b)
Primary key of R = {C, E} (as seen in exercise 2.1 a)
-> Table is not in Boyce-Codd normal form because ABC -> D, E -> D and D -> A, B are not trivial as well as ABC, E and D are / contain not a key.

Exercise 2.2
a)
A B C D E F
1 1 1 1 1 1
2 1 2 1 3 1
3 2 3 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 2 1
4 2 2 1 1 1

b)
Inserting (1 1 1 2 1 1):

AB -> C     works
B -> DF     does not work because 1 (B) -> 2 (D) does violate the functional dependency which proposes 1 (B) -> 1 (D) (B -> F works)
BE -> F     works
A -> F      works

Hence, inserting this row into the above table will violate the given functional dependencies.
