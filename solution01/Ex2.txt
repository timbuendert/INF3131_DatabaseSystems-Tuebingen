# Exercise 2: Twitter Mini World

Mini worlds present well-defined subsets of the real world which can be captured by database systems. 
Generally, a mini world contains the relevant objects with their significant attributes and captures both relationships and constraints within this world.
In this exercise, this concept is applied to Twitter and, more specifically, to the files "users.json" and "tweets.json".

Objects: User, Tweet
These objects contain nested information (further details) while being related in both directions. 
In addition, they are the building blocks of the mini world which is then further characterized by their respective attributes.

Attributes: screen_name, text & hashtag, users.id & tweets.id, lang (language), retweet_count, created_at (Date/Time), ...
The two most significant attributes are the screen_name and text with the corresponding hashtags as this information is most essential to a tweet. 
In addition, the created_at attribute positions the tweet in a temporal context.
Furthermore, users.id and tweets.id present unique identifiers of the respective objects and are therefore crucial to access additional information.
Moreover, the language (lang) and retweet_count are useful details concerning the target audience and gained popularity of the respective tweet.

Relationships: 
User writes Tweet.

Constraints: 
"One tweet can only be published by a one user."
"Tweet-ID, User-ID and the screen_name have to be present and unique."
"Length (len()) of the text of a tweet can only be between 1 and 280"
"One User-ID corresponds to one screen_name and vice versa."
